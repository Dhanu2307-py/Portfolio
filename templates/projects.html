        <h2>AI-Based Epidemic Detection from X-Rays</h2>
        <p>
          Developed a deep learning model using <strong>VGG16</strong> to classify chest X-rays into four categories:
          COVID-19, Pneumonia, Pulmonary Tuberculosis, and Normal. Trained on 12,000 images, achieving
          <strong>85% accuracy</strong> with high sensitivity and specificity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built using <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>Keras</strong>, and <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, the system aims to offer
          cost-effective, rapid medical diagnostics.

        <h2>Edge-Assisted Crime Prediction Framework</h2>
        <p>
          Designed a machine learning framework using <strong>Decision Trees</strong> to predict criminal activity,
          achieving <strong>81% accuracy</strong>. Used historical and demographic data with edge computing
          to analyze risks across regions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Enhanced public safety insights through interactive crime pattern visualizations.
