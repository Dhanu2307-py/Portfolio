    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! I'm <strong>Dhanunjay Tippana</strong>, a Computer Science and Engineering student at Narasimha Reddy Engineering College, Hyderabad, with a specialization in Data Science.
      I am an enthusiastic and attentive learner, passionate about solving real-world problems through intelligent systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have experience working with <strong>Python, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and basic JavaScript</strong>. My focus lies in <strong>AI, machine learning, and web development</strong>, 
      and I’m skilled with tools like <strong>Jupyter, VS Code, and PyCharm</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of my key projects include an <strong>AI-based epidemic detection system</strong> using VGG16 to classify chest X-rays, and an 
      <strong>Edge-Assisted Crime Prediction Framework</strong> that predicts crime types using decision tree algorithms with 81% accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve completed certifications in Python, Data Analytics, HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and recently interned at <strong>Datapoint Info Solutions</strong>, where I implemented 
      a real-time crime prediction model using edge computing techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am constantly exploring new technologies and frameworks, and I'm eager to contribute to innovative projects in AI and software development that reflect my skills and creativity.
